# XYZ Position Gizmo for Path3D

The built-in Godot Path3D gizmos don't allow for per-component editing. This gizmo adds separate
X, Y and Z handles to each point in the Path3D's curve. It's a very rough plugin, I got it to a
functional state and called it that. It's unpolished, and I hope it gets obsoleted soon in favour
of an out-of-the-box gizmo improvement in core.

Example 6-point Path3D without this plugin:

And with the plugin:
